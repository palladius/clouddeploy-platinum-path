              I copied and pasted web.yaml inside base and now Im trying to use kustomize instead.
              Not sure if Ill survive but we'll see.
              Why am I using Kustomize? Thanks for asking. Two reasons mainly:
              1. Learn kustomize
              2. the only legitimate reason is to DRY the 4 dev/stagingca/ary/prod while injecting
                 a slight difference in Canary vs Prod config (9 vs 1 Replicas respectively)
