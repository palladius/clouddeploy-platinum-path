            Hi! This is the default message if you dont customize to come to another
            target (dev, prod, ..). This was fixed in v1.16 with port mismatch.
            I'm still trying to bake the CD target into this which kustomize should add in
            overlays but nisba: ENV['RICCARDO_KUSTOMIZE_ENV'] seems null.
            Btw moved 9292 to 8080 since I need
        - name: FAVORITE_COLOR
          value: pink # default bkg color, will make it white in prod and yellow in canary.
